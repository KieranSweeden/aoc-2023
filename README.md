# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023 solutions written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

## Repository structure

Each day has its own cargo package associated with it, containing both part 1 & part 2 binary files. The parts share the same lib, likely resulting in them sharing the same tests.

## Solution methodology

My aim with these solutions is to gain a deeper understanding of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Priorities to achieve this aim include:

- Getting comfortable with the borrow checker.
- Error handling the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) way using <code>Option</code> & <code>Result</code>.
- Managing cargo package structure.
- Using Rust's various in-built data structures & types.

The following will be taken into account but will not be prioritized:

- Performance
- Optimization

Despite these being valid concerns, I choose to not prioritize them for the sole purpose of continuing through the challenges. This will allow me to solve a variety of problems, escaping the likelihood of getting into a rut over one particular problem, stifling my progress as a consequence.
