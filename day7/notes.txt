Camel cards, a similar game to poker but more simple.

You get a list of hands, your goal is to roder them based on the "strength" of each hand.

A hand consists of 5 cards labeled using the letters of each special card and numbers from 2 to 9.

The relative strength of each card follows the order of:
A, K, Q, J, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Every hand can fall within the following "types", starting from strongest to weakest, they are:
- Five of a kind - all five cards have the same label: AAAAA
- Four of a kind - four cards have the same label and one is different: AA8AA
- Full house - three cards have the same label and the other two share a different label: 23322
- Three of a kind - 3 cards have the same label, the other two are different: TTT98
- Two pair - 2 cards share one label, another 2 share a different label, 1 remaining card is different: 23432
- One pair - two cards share one label, the other 3 cards each have different labels: A23A4
- High card - all card labels are different

Hands are ordered based on type: every full house > three of a kind.

If hands are the same type: they are then ordered by which hand has "strongest" card first.
E.g. 33332 & 2AAAA are both four of a kind, but the first is stronger as 3 is greater than 2.
77888 & 77788 are both full house, but the first is stronger as third digit of the first is greater than the third digit of the second.

We are given a list of hands, alongside each is a corresponding "bid".

The ranking order of the hands, dictate the multiplier set for each bid.

To determing winnings for each hand,
the lowest ranking hand's bid get multipled by 1,
whereas the highest ranking hand's bid get's multiplied by the amount of total hands.

We then sum up all the winnings together to get the total amount of winnings which will be our target.
